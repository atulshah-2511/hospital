    <P><b>Orthopedics is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis, correction, prevention, and treatment of patients with skeletal deformities -
       disorders of the bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves and skin. These elements make up the musculoskeletal system.
       Many developments in orthopedic surgery have resulted from experiences during wartime. On the battlefields of the Middle Ages, the injured were treated with bandages soaked in horses' blood, 
       which dried to form a stiff, but unsanitary, splint.
             Originally, the term orthopedics meant the correcting of musculoskeletal deformities in children. Nicolas Andry, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris, 
             coined the term in the first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation, and splinting to treat deformities in children. 
             His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of the palms' and freckles.
             Jean-Andr√© Venel established the first orthopedic institute in 1780, which was the first hospital dedicated to the treatment of children's skeletal deformities.
             He developed the club-foot shoe for children born with foot deformities and various methods to treat curvature of the spine.
