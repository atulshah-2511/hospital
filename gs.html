    <P><b>Surgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a specialty of a general surgeon), but thoracic surgical oncologists, 
      gynecologist and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients.
      The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, 
      supported by a number of clinical trials, that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume—i.e., 
      the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. 
      This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted—even as common sense—that a surgeon who performs a given operation more often,
      will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. 
      This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.
      Surgical oncology is generally a 2 year fellowship following completion of a general surgery residency (5-7 years).</b></P>
