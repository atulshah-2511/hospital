      <P><b>One of the first major discoveries relevant to the field of pulmonology was the discovery of pulmonary circulation.
         Originally, it was thought that blood reaching the right side of the heart passed through small 'pores' in the septum into the left side to be oxygenated, 
         as theorized by Galen; however, the discovery of pulmonary circulation disproves this theory, which had previously been accepted since the 2nd century. 
         Thirteenth-century anatomist and physiologist Ibn Al-Nafis accurately theorized that there was no 'direct' passage between the two sides (ventricles) of the heart.
         THe believed that the blood must have passed through the pulmonary artery, through the lungs, and back into the heart to be pumped around the body. 
         This is believed by many to be the first scientific description of pulmonary circulation.
                  Although pulmonary medicine only began to evolve as a medical specialty in the 1950s, 
                  William Welch and William Osler founded the 'parent' organization of the American Thoracic Society, 
                  the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis.[5] The care, treatment, 
                  and study of tuberculosis of the lung is recognised as a discipline in its own right, phthisiology.
                   When the specialty did begin to evolve, several discoveries were being made linking the respiratory system and the measurement of arterial blood gases, 
                   attracting more and more physicians and researchers to the developing field.</b></P>
