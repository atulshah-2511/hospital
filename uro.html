    <P><b>The American Urological Association defines urology as a specialty that deals with diseases of the male and female urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). 
      It also deals with the male reproductive organs (penis, testes, scrotum, prostate, etc.). Urology is a surgical specialty.
      Urological techniques include minimally invasive robotic and laparoscopic surgery, laser-assisted surgeries, and other scope-guided procedures.
      Urologists receive training in open and minimally invasive surgical techniques, employing real-time ultrasound guidance, fiber-optic endoscopic equipment,
      and various lasers in the treatment of multiple benign and malignant conditions. Urology is closely related to (and urologists often collaborate with the practitioners of) oncology, 
      nephrology, gynaecology, andrology, pediatric surgery, colorectal surgery, gastroenterology, and endocrinology.
      Urologists are physicians which have specialized in the field after completing their general degree in medicine. Upon successful completion of a residency program,
      many urologists choose to undergo further advanced training in a subspecialty area of expertise through a fellowship lasting an additional 12 to 36 months.
      Subspecialties may include: urologic surgery, urologic oncology and urologic oncological surgery, endourology and endourologic surgery, urogynecology and urogynecologic surgery, reconstructive urologic surgery (a form of reconstructive surgery),
      minimally-invasive urologic surgery, pediatric urology and pediatric urologic surgery (including adolescent urology, the treatment of premature or delayed puberty, and the treatment of congenital urological syndromes. </b></P>
